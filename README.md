## Overview

The purpose of this project is to come up with a plan about the start of a potential ride sharing company.  Using data and analysis from a ride sharing company in New York City, a visualization was put together in Tableau to present to potential investors.  The use of different graphs and visuals produced in Tableau, it is our hope to sway the investors to invest capital into a ride sharing program in another city in the U.S.  

## Results

![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top_Starting_Locations.png)

On page 1 of the project Story in Tableau, you'll see the above image.  This outlines the starting locations of the bike share for the month of August in the year 2019.  

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top_Ending_Locations.png)

On page 2 of the project Story in Tableau, you'll see the above image.  This shows the ending locations of the same data for the same time frame.  They are pretty similar with only slight variations on endpoints from the start points.  This insinuates most people drop the bike off around the same place that they started.  

![Average Trip Length](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Average_Trip_Length.png)

This is on page 3 of the project story.  This shows the average length of the bike rental or trip that the customer used.  The peak or average seems to be around 5 minutes.  This shows that the bikes are not really used for long periods of time.  It should be noted however this does not tell us how rough the bikes are handled or how far they travel.
For reference, each new image will be on the next page of the story and will not be stated in their summary.

![Average Trip Length - Gender](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Average_Trip_Length_Gender.png)

This tells us similar information to the one above but a breakdown in gender is applied.  We can clearly see that males use the service more than females or unknowns.  But interestingly enough, all 3 groups use the bikes for about the same period of time.

![Trips By Weekday/Hour](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_Weekday_Hour.png)

This chart tells us a breakdown of peak times that the service is in use on which hours of the day on which days of the week.  It follows a similar pattern of working a 9 to 5 job; i.e., the most frequent rental times are around/before 9am and around/after 5pm.

![Trips By Weekday/Hour and Gender](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_Weekday_Hour_Gender.png)

This is a graph similar to the one above it, just broken down even further into gender.  It follows a similar pattern as the one related to trip length.

![User Trips](https://github.com/wprich/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User_Trips.png)

The last graph tells us which customer type uses the service more frequently on which days and also the gender of the customer types.  We can easily deduce that subscribers use the servive more frequently than regular customers and that again, males seem to make more use of the service than the other two categories.


## Summary
[Link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.richardson1787/viz/ProjectCitiBike/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes)

This dive into the ride sharing business in New York City has shown that it is indeed widely used and potentially a profitable business if implemented correctly.  One inforgraphic that could be useful start and stop locations by the day of the week.  That is, to see which areas get more use during certain days of the week.  This could be used to provide more bikes on certain days at certain locations if the demand is seen to be there.  Another good infographic would be average trip duration not tied to the day of the week, but the date itself.  This could show us is there a rush on holidays, local events, or is it more busy on the standard work week.  All of the information in both of the above infographics could be used to plan for busy seasons/days and also maybe help plan a maintenance and repair component of the company to ensure the bikes are safe and well maintained.
