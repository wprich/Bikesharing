## Overview

The purpose of this project is to come up with a plan about the start of a potential ride sharing company.  Using data and analysis from a ride sharing company in New York City, a visualization was put together in Tableau to present to potential investors.  The use of different graphs and visuals produced in Tableau, it is our hope to sway the investors to invest capital into a ride sharing program in another city in the U.S.
